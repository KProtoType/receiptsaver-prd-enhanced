ReceiptSaver

### 1.2 Product Description
ReceiptSaver is a mobile application that incentivizes users to scan grocery receipts to earn cashback rewards by aggregating deals from multiple affiliate platforms (e.g., Ibotta) and presenting them in a minimalist, user-friendly interface.

- Provides a minimalist and intuitive user experience to maximize adoption and usage.

### 1.4 Target Audience

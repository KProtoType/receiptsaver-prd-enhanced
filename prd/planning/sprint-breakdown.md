## Story Point Allocation Guidelines

Each sprint is allocated approximately 18-24 story points, with the following guidelines for different task types:

| Task Type | Size | Typical SP Range |
|-----------|------|------------------|
| Simple UI implementation | Small | 1-2 |
| Complex UI with interactions | Medium | 3-5 |
| API integration | Medium-Large | 5-8 |
| Core feature implementation | Large | 8-13 |
| Research/exploratory work | Variable | 2-5 |
| Testing/bug fixing | Small | 1-3 |

Teams should adjust these based on their velocity and experience.
